ABOUT CYDIN
===========

Cydin is an ASP.NET add-in repository web site for Mono.Addins based
applications.

Add-in developers can publish their add-ins in a Cydin web site and make them
available to all users. The site works like a build bot: it pulls the source
code of add-ins from version control repositories, builds and packages them,
and then publishes them in an add-in repository, to which MonoDevelop will be
subscribed.

Cydin is composed by two services:

* The Cydin web site is the frontend to the repository. It allows users to
  create new add-in projects and register add-in sources, and to download
  existing add-ins.

* The Cydin build service is in charge of pulling the add-in source code,
  build the add-ins and publish them. This service can be installed in a
  different machine

DEPENDENCIES
============

The basic dependencies are:

* Mono 2.6
* Mysql (tested with 5.1.46)

Cydin also depends on some open source libraries which are included as
binaries in the repository to make it easier to build the project.
Those libraries are:

* Contracts.dll (http://code.google.com/p/mono-soc-2010)
* DotNetOpenAuth (http://github.com/slluis/dotnetopenid)
* ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib (get it from Mono)
* log4net (http://logging.apache.org/log4net)
* Mono.Addins (http://monoaddins.codeplex.com)
* mysql.data (http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net)
* ASP.NET MVC 2.0 (get it from Mono)

BUILDING
========

Open Cydin.sln in MonoDevelop and run the build command, or run xbuild in
the root project directory.

DATABASE SETUP
==============

The database script creation (create.sql) is available in the 'db' directory.
To setup the database you have to:

1) Create a new database in mysql
2) run the create.sql script on that database
3) In Cydin/Web.config, look for 'CommunityAddinRepoConnectionString'. In the
   connectionString attribute, set the address of the mysql server, the name
   of the database, and the database user and password for the connection.

RUNNING
=======

To test the web site, start xsp2 in the Cydin directory, and then open
localhost:8080 in your browser, or just click on Run in MonoDevelop.
